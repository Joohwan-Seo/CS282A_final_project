# CS282A Final Froject

This is a repo for the final project for Berkeley's CS282A : Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks.

The goal of our project is to recreate the results of PointNet(https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) and to turn it into a homework problem set that could be accomplished by our class members.
